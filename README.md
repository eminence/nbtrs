# nbtrs

A NBT and McRegion library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/overviewer/nbtrs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/overviewer/nbtrs)

# Installation

This crate is not yet hosted on crates.io, so you will have to reference the git repo directly:

```toml
[dependencies]
nbtrs = {git="https://github.com/overviewer/nbtrs"}
```

Note that this library has not reached version 1.0 yet, and so the API should still be considered unstable
